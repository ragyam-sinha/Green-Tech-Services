            <p>
              Our journey began with a vision to revolutionize e-waste management in India. With over 3.2 million metric tons of e-waste generated annually, the improper handling of electronic waste poses severe environmental and health risks. Our platform was created to address these issues by connecting customers with licensed vendors, ensuring that e-waste is recycled responsibly.

            <p>
              Recycling e-waste is crucial for several reasons. Electronics contain valuable materials such as gold, silver, copper, and rare earth elements, which can be recovered and reused. Proper recycling ensures that these resources are not wasted and prevents toxic substances from contaminating the environment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through proper recycling, we reduce the demand for new raw materials, conserve energy, and minimize the carbon footprint associated with the manufacturing of new electronic devices.

          <h2 className="section-title">How Our Platform Works</h2>
          <div className="content-card">
            <p>
              Our platform connects customers with licensed vendors who collect their e-waste. The waste is then sent to certified recycling facilities, where it undergoes a series of processes, including sorting, shredding, and material recovery.
            </p>
            <p>
              A key feature of our platform is the integration of machine learning models that predict the price of waste materials based on current market trends, material composition, and condition. This ensures that customers receive fair compensation while vendors can optimize their profits.
